# Challenge Project: Tutorial Blog Post

## Due by the end of the day on Friday, April 24

That's the Friday before classes end.

Note that I **will not accept late submissions** for the challenge projects!

## Description

Write and publish a blog post that teaches the reader about an aspect of Python programming.

The goals of this assignment are:

- To practice researching features of Python beyond the ones we've talked about in class.

- To practice writing about technical topics in a clear and effective way.

- To get some experience creating and publishing documents on the web.

- To think about the meta-game of lesson planning and instructional design, which underlies a lot of the work you do in your other classes.

There are a few different approaches you can take in your post:

- Pick a feature of the Python language and talk about how to use it, giving some motivation and examples. This should be something other than one of the major language features we've talked about in class (`if` statements, `for` and `while` loops, `def` and functions, etc.).

- Choose a built-in function or library and talk about how to use it. This should be one that requires non-trivial understanding to use effectively (`sqrt` for example, is pretty straightforward). Examples could include working with dates and times, more random number generation tools, or how Python handles very large numbers. If you want to look at some external libraries that might be relevant to your work in another class, that would also be okay.

- Find an interesting problem and talk through its solution using Python. Project Euler and LeetCode are both sites that have large archives of problems and could serve as a starting place. You could also pick an interesting algorithm and talk through its implementation.

## Specifications

Your post must have the following elements:

1. Overview of the topic of your post. This section should describe what you're going to discuss and why it's interesting or useful for readers to know.

2. Basic desciption of the language feature / function / problem you're considering. If you're talking about a language element, how do you use it in a program? If you're talking about a problem, describe the solution strategy and give a worked example.

3. Mid-point check-in: a question that the reader should be able to answer after reading the first part of your post.

4. Details. Give an example program that uses your feature or implements the solution to your problem.

5. Final check-in: another question that the reader should be able to answer after reading the complete post.

The length will take care of itself if you are doing a good job of explaining your concepts in detail. Proofread for correct spelling, grammar, etc. Any code you include should be properly formatted using a `monospaced font`.

**Ask me if you have questions**. Feel free to check your topic idea before you start writing. I can also provide feedback on your in-progress work.


### References

You are allowed to use other sites or books as references for your post. You can either

- Link to the relevant site in the text of your post.

- Add a References section at the end of the document and list the sites there.

You don't need to use any specific citation format (ugh): just create links to the relevant pages that you used for background info.

## Submission and Grading

Upload a link to your post using the assignment submission I'll create on Canvas.

There are several sites you can use to create a free blog post.

- Wordpress
- Blogger
- GitHub Pages (more involved, but useful if you want to start building a personal portfolio site)

If your post meets the specifications described above, you'll receive credit and your final course grade will be increased by **one part
of a letter** (e.g., from B to B+ or B+ to A-).
