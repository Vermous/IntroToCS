# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Description

If you had been a kid in the 80's, your elementary school library would have been stuffed with *Choose Your Own Adventure* books.

Each book was the story of "you", the nameless protagonist, making your way through some type of fantastic adventure story. After reading for a few pages, you'd be offered a choice:

- If you choose to explore the mysterious Cave of Time, turn to page 41.

- If you would rather go back to your house and make a sandwich, go to page 17.

Each choice would lead to a different path of the story and eventually you would reach an ending page, which might good, bad, or curiously ambiguous.
