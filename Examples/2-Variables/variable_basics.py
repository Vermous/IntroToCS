# Basic idea: a variable is a name associated with a value
# Values in Python are basic data: numbers, strings

# Mental model: a "box" with a name that holds some data
# Refer to the data in the box using its name

# First example: area of a rectangle

# Create variables to describe the length and width of
# the rectangle
length = 3
width = 5

# Use a variable assignment to calculate the area
area = length * width
