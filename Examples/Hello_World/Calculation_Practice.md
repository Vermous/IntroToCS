## McChocolate Potatoes

The Japanese yen currently trades for about $.0094.

I'm a sucker for regional fast food items. It turns out that you can get **chocolate fries** at [McDonald's in Japan](https://www.eater.com/2016/1/19/10790586/mcdonalds-chocolate-fries-japan) (they are officially known
as "McChocolate Potatoes"). Are they any good? Maybe not, but they cost only 330 yen as a side item.

What is the cost of a side of chocolate fries in dollars?

## Pool Party

I love problems that ask you to convert normal units into ridiculous units.

The world's largest swimming pool is at the San Alfonso del Mar resort in Chile. It measures 3323 feet long, covers 20 acres, and contains about 66 million US gallons of water.

A **firkin** is an old unit sometimes used to measure beer and ale in Britain. The British Imperial beer firkin is defined to be equal to 10.8 US gallons.

Suppose we wanted to fill the San Alfonso del Mar pool with beer, because **reasons**. How many firkins of beer would be required to accomplish this feat?
